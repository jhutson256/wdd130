            <h1>Who is this Website for?</h1>
            <p>
                Have you ever looked at a piano and thought, “How in the world am I supposed to 
                move that thing without throwing out my back?”  This website was made by a 
                professional piano mover to help answer that question. Whether you're planning 
                on moving a piano yourself or you're just curious, this advice can have practical 
                use for you. This website is full of advice on the safest, easiest ways to move 
                any piano. From the best equipment to use, to the best ways to manipulate the 
                weight of a piano making it easier to move, and even the proper ways to safely 
                transport pianos. With this advice, you'll be a piano moving pro just like me, 
                and better yet, you won't have to visit the chiropractor afterwards.

            <h1>Should You Move a Piano?</h1>
            <p>
                The biggest deciding factor in whether you can move a piano is your overall strength. 
                If you can lift around 500 pounds, then you can move a piano. With that being said, 
                there are still a lot of things you can learn from this website that you can apply to 
                moving anything, so stick around! There are a lot of pianos that you can move by 
                yourself with the right equipment. However, I always recommend having at least one 
                other person to help you move a piano. If you cannot lift around 500 pounds, if you 
                don't have access to a box truck, or if you have to move a piano up or down a flight 
                of stairs, then I recommend hiring professional piano movers. Professional piano movers 
                have extra equipment, training, and insurance to handle those kinds of moves.
