                To move an upright piano, you and another person should stand on either side of 
                the piano. First, grab the handle at the back of the piano with one hand, and grab 
                the area in front of the keys with the other hand. Then, count down so both of you 
                lift the piano up at the same time and make sure to lift with your legs. You'll 
                then place the piano on your dolly, so make sure to put the dolly either in front 
                of or behind the piano before you lift. Once the piano is on the dolly, make sure 
                that the back of the piano is flush with the dolly, you can slide it and readjust 
                it while it's on the dolly. You also want the dolly to be centered under the piano. 
                Once the piano is on the dolly you can move the piano! Make sure to have one person 
                on either side of the piano while you are moving the piano and that you both have a 
                good grip on the piano. Once the piano is in the truck, you want to have the back of 
                the piano against the wall of the truck. Place a folded moving blanket on either side 
                of the piano and place one in the middle. Then, strap it in with 2 ratchet straps 
                lined up on top of each other, and have them strapped against the top front panel with 
                the fall board closed. Make sure the straps are nice and tight, and it should be ready 
                to transport!

                First, tuck a blanket under the fall board and close the fall board with the blanket 
                tucked in, then put the excess blanket under the lid and close the lid with the blanket 
                underneath. Next, one person should lift the front corner of the flat side of the piano 
                while someone places a folded blanket underneath the pedals. Please note, the front leg 
                on the flat side of the piano should be off the ground. Then, take off that leg and line 
                your board up with the flat side of the piano. You want to make sure that your dolly is 
                underneath your grand board and placed correctly. With the front of the piano lined up 
                with the front of the grand board, the front of the dolly should be lined up with where 
                the front leg would be. Now, lay an unfolded blanket on the board, this will be used to 
                cover the lid of the piano once it's on its side. Lay the piano down on to the board, the 
                bottom of the piano should only be an inch or two from the edge of the board on the side 
                away from the lid. Get on the other side of the piano where the leg is now raised up and 
                wrap your rubber band around the piano there, so the lid doesn't open. Now, lift the piano 
                with your legs, while somebody is on the other side of the board holding the dolly wheels. 
                Once the piano is on its side, make sure the lid is flush with the board and cover the piano 
                with the blanket you placed down earlier. Once the piano is covered put a folded blanket on 
                the curve of the piano and another folded blanket where the keys are. Then, place two straps 
                on the areas that you just covered with blankets in an x shape. Once that is done, it's ready 
                to move! Always move the piano with one person on either side and always push from the keys. 
                Once the piano is in the truck, make sure that the lid is against the wall of the truck. One 
                strap goes along the top and another strap goes along the bottom. Make sure to tighten them 
                well, and the piano should be ready to transport!
