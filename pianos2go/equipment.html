                <p>
                    This equipment will be used when moving any kind of piano. First, you will 
                    need at least an 18” by 30” 4 wheeled furniture dolly. A dolly this size is 
                    plenty big enough and strong enough to handle the weight of any piano. If you 
                    plan on moving a piano by yourself, then you need to get a fixed wheeled 
                    4-wheel furniture dolly. Next, I recommend you have at least 3 72” by 80” moving 
                    blankets, if you're moving a grand piano, then you will need at least 5 of those 
                    moving blankets. The last thing that you will need is at least 2 ratchet straps 
                    for upright pianos, and at least 4 ratchet straps for grand pianos. This is all 
                    of the equipment that you will need to move an upright piano, or a digital piano, 
                    you will need extra equipment for a grand piano.

                <h2>Grand Piano Equipment</h2>
                <p>
                    On top of the equipment needed in the general equipment section, you will also 
                    need a grand board, and a rubber band. First, the grand board. The grand board 
                    (shown in the picture next to this section) is what the piano will be laying on 
                    and strapped to in order to safely move the piano. There are grand boards for each 
                    general size of a grand piano, for example, there are 5', 6', 7', 8', and 9' grand 
                    boards. If you have a piano that is in between two of those sizes, for example, 5' 6" 
                    or 6' 7", you will want to get the board that is the next size up. Always remember, 
                    you'd rather have your board be too long, rather than too short. The next piece of 
                    equipment you will need is a rubber band. This will be used to keep the lid from 
                    opening when you tip the piano up on its side on the grand board. The rubber band 
                    should be at least 3/4" wide and 36" diameter.
