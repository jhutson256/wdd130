        This website was made by a professional piano mover for people who want to know the best ways to 
        move a piano. Whether you're planning on moving a piano yourself or you're just curious, this advice 
        can have practical use for you. This website is full of advice on the safest, easiest ways to move 
        any piano. From the best equipment to use, to the best ways to manipulate the weight of a piano making 
        it easier to move, and even the proper ways to safely transport pianos. With this advice, you'll be a 
        piano moving pro just like me, and better yet, you won't have to visit the chiropractor afterwards.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - write about your intended audience. Who are they? How old are they? Why will they be using your site? What do you want them to do? -->
      <p>
        The intended audience for this website is anyone who has the size and strength to move a piano. 
        That age range would typically fall between 16 to about 60 to 70 years old. The biggest deciding 
        factor on who can move a piano is the person's overall strength. If you can lift around 500 pounds, 
        then you can move a piano. This website will best serve those who want or need to move a piano, 
        but don't know the best ways to move a piano without hurting themselves.

        Who is this Website for? Have you ever looked at a piano and thought, "How in the world 
        am I supposed to move that thing without throwing out my back?"  This website was made 
        by a professional piano mover to help answer that question. Whether you're planning on 
        moving a piano yourself or you're just curious, this advice can have practical use for 
        you. This website is full of advice on the safest, easiest ways to move any piano. From 
        the best equipment to use, to the best ways to manipulate the weight of a piano making it 
        easier to move, and even the proper ways to safely transport pianos. With this advice, 
        you'll be a piano moving pro just like me, and better yet, you won't have to visit the 
        chiropractor afterwards. Should You Move a Piano? The biggest deciding factor in whether 
        you can move a piano is your overall strength. If you can lift around 500 pounds, then you 
        can move a piano. With that being said, there are still a lot of things you can learn from 
        this website that you can apply to moving anything, so stick around! There are a lot of 
        pianos that you can move by yourself with the right equipment. However, I always recommend 
        having at least one other person to help you move a piano. If you cannot lift around 500 
        pounds, if you don't have access to a box truck, or if you have to move a piano up or down 
        a flight of stairs, then I recommend hiring professional piano movers. Professional piano 
        movers have extra equipment, training, and insurance to handle those kinds of moves.

      <h3>Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        General Equipment: This equipment will be used when moving any kind of piano. First, you will 
        need at least an 18" by 30" 4 wheeled furniture dolly. A dolly this size is plenty big enough 
        and strong enough to handle the weight of any piano. If you plan on moving a piano by yourself, 
        then you need to get a fixed wheeled 4-wheel furniture dolly. Next, I recommend you have at 
        least 3 72” by 80” moving blankets, if you're moving a grand piano, then you will need at least 
        5 of those moving blankets. The last thing that you will need is at least 2 ratchet straps for 
        upright pianos, and at least 4 ratchet straps for grand pianos. This is all of the equipment that 
        you will need to move an upright piano, or a digital piano, you will need extra equipment for a 
        grand piano. Grand Piano Equipment: On top of the equipment needed in the general equipment 
        section, you will also need a grand board, and a rubber band. First, the grand board. The grand 
        board (shown in the picture next to this section) is what the piano will be laying on and strapped 
        to in order to safely move the piano. There are grand boards for each general size of a grand piano, 
        for example, there are 5', 6', 7', 8', and 9' grand boards. If you have a piano that is in between 
        two of those sizes, for example, 5' 6" or 6' 7", you will want to get the board that is the next size 
        up. Always remember, you'd rather have your board be too long, rather than too short. The next piece 
        of equipment you will need is a rubber band. This will be used to keep the lid from opening when you 
        tip the piano up on its side on the grand board. The rubber band should be at least 3/4" wide and 36" 
        diameter.

      <h3>Moving</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        Upright Pianos: To move an upright piano, you and another person should stand on either side of the 
        piano. First, grab the handle at the back of the piano with one hand, and grab the area in front of 
        the keys with the other hand. Then, count down so both of you lift the piano up at the same time and 
        make sure to lift with your legs. You'll then place the piano on your dolly, so make sure to put the 
        dolly either in front of or behind the piano before you lift. Once the piano is on the dolly, make 
        sure that the back of the piano is flush with the dolly, you can slide it and readjust it while it's 
        on the dolly. You also want the dolly to be centered under the piano. Once the piano is on the dolly 
        you can move the piano! Make sure to have one person on either side of the piano while you are moving 
        the piano and that you both have a good grip on the piano. Once the piano is in the truck, you want to 
        have the back of the piano against the wall of the truck. Place a folded moving blanket on either side 
        of the piano and place one in the middle. Then, strap it in with 2 ratchet straps lined up on top of 
        each other, and have them strapped against the top front panel with the fall board closed. Make sure 
        the straps are nice and tight, and it should be ready to transport! Grand Pianos: First, tuck a blanket 
        under the fall board and close the fall board with the blanket tucked in, then put the excess blanket 
        under the lid and close the lid with the blanket underneath. Next, one person should lift the front 
        corner of the flat side of the piano while someone places a folded blanket underneath the pedals. Please 
        note, the front leg on the flat side of the piano should be off the ground. Then, take off that leg and 
        line your board up with the flat side of the piano. You want to make sure that your dolly is underneath 
        your grand board and placed correctly. With the front of the piano lined up with the front of the grand 
        board, the front of the dolly should be lined up with where the front leg would be. Now, lay an unfolded 
        blanket on the board, this will be used to cover the lid of the piano once it's on its side. Lay the piano 
        down on to the board, the bottom of the piano should only be an inch or two from the edge of the board on 
        the side away from the lid. Get on the other side of the piano where the leg is now raised up and wrap your 
        rubber band around the piano there, so the lid doesn't open. Now, lift the piano with your legs, while 
        somebody is on the other side of the board holding the dolly wheels. Once the piano is on its side, make 
        sure the lid is flush with the board and cover the piano with the blanket you placed down earlier. Once 
        the piano is covered put a folded blanket on the curve of the piano and another folded blanket where the 
        keys are. Then, place two straps on the areas that you just covered with blankets in an x shape. Once that 
        is done, it's ready to move! Always move the piano with one person on either side and always push from the 
        keys. Once the piano is in the truck, make sure that the lid is against the wall of the truck. One strap 
        goes along the top and another strap goes along the bottom. Make sure to tighten them well, and the piano 
        should be ready to transport!

        I felt that this layout would be unique, cool, and would help fill the page a little bit more 
        since this page doesn't have as much text as the other pages. I also plan on having the first 
        section enlarge when hovering so it comes on top of everything else and makes it easier to read 
        for anyone just trying to read that section.
