                <div id="main-info">
                    <p>
                    I'm a freshman at BYU Idaho, this is my first semester, and I'm majoring in web development 
                    and design. I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. I served my mission in the Montana Billings Mission. 
                    I love to go fishing and spend time outdoors. I also love working with computers which is 
                    why I decided to major in web development and design. My favorite sports are football and 
                    baseball, and I'm a fan of all of the Arizona sports teams. I have been a member of the 
                    church for about 8 years now. I'm a convert in the church, I was baptized when I was 14 years 
                    old. I'm the only member of the church in my family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My hope and goal is to eventually be a full stack web developer. My ultimate dream is to 
                    own my own business, but I'd also be happy being a freelance web developer. I find a lot of
                    joy in building and creating things, so I think it would be super awesome to not only build
                    websites for a living, but to also be able to build a business out of that as well. I have 
                    worked with html and css earlier in my life, but that was when I was about 12 years old. I 
                    have found that I really enjoy coding, and I especially enjoy coding with python, which I 
                    just started learning.
