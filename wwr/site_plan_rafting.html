      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your purpose here] with your purpose in creating the website. This is NOT the reason for the assignment in the class. It is the reason the site owner would want to make this website -->
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help reach more customers to use our white water rafting services. 
         We will advertise the various different equipment that they can buy or rent. We will also advertise 
         our expert white water rafting guide services. We will advertise our family owned, family operated,
         and family friendly brand. We will provide them with the information that they need to find our stores 
         and learn more about our company. We will also feature all of our white water rafting product sales 
         going on at our stores, and all of our fantastic professional rafting guides. Additionally, we will 
         inform them on the quality of our products, and why to choose our products and our guides for their 
         rafting trips. Finally, we will provide them with a booking option on the website, so they can book
         their guide and equipment in advance of their trip without having to call or visit our store.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your audience here] with your audience. Who are they? What are their ages? What do they like to do? Why would they want to look at this website? You could even go as far as giving them names and bios-->
      <p>Our target audience will be people who love the great outdoors, but don't have the experience to go
        rafting on their own. The majority of our audience will be families with parents and young children 
        as well as other outdoors youth groups. These families and youth groups will need to be in a good 
        middle to upper class financial situation to afford to go out on these rafting trips, and to buy or 
        rent rafting products, and to use rafting guides for their trip. They will want to have the best, most
        fun rafting experience they can get for the money that they're spending. They will want reliable rafting
        products, and fun professional guides that will help them have a fun experience without worrying about
        the danger that can come with it. Our audience will most likely be accessing this website by computer 
        or laptop, since they will be planning their trips well in advance, and will want to schedule and pay 
        everything while they're scheduling their trip.
